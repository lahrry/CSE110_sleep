## Productivity Tracking

### UCSD students often feel guilty about sleeping at night because they feel that their time is being wasted when they arenâ€™t using it to be productive. Our sleeping app helps their sleep quality by addressing the root of the problem: their anxiety and guilt caused by perceived lack of productivity. With an app that lets them set productivity goals for their day, and then provides them time to reflect on everything they accomplished each night, it reminds them how productive they were that day so that they can go to sleep at ease.
